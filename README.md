 Streaming Data Applications Made Easy


## About The Project

This project presents a methodology for the development of streaming data
applications based on the Model-driven engineering paradigm. The applications are
created using a high-level design with a domain specific visual language, so that it is
not a requirement that users have prior technical knowledge in the field. To support this
methodology, we have developed an open-source tool called Datalyzer.

Datalyzer is a web platform where each user has a personal space to create, store and
run applications in a self-managed way. The domain specific language this thesis presents
is integrated into the platform in a graphical interface that contains components which
can be interconnected to represent data flows. Datalyzer incorporates a preconfigured
collection of data sources and processors that can be used in the applications. In addition,
an extension point is offered to allow users adding new data sources and custom processors
with the creation of models that contain their configuration. Once the design process is
completed, applications are generated automatically using a code generator. The tool has
a dashboard where users can monitor and manage the applications that are running in
Datalyzer. In addition, the dashboard is also a data visualization tool and it can receive
the data that the applications process.
